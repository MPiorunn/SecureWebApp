# SecureWebApp
Spring/React application I write to learn about web-app security principles:
- Password(hash) storage with BCrypt, salt and pepper
- Password reset mechanism with random UUID tokens


To be added
- Very strict policies in html headers
- Different user for database (not root!)
- Secure websites (protection from CSRF etc)
- Usage of HTTPS (obviously)
- Dependency checking once every some time period ;)
- Using Valut
